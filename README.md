# EDA on the IMDB dataset and Training and Evaluation on FastText Model

* `DL2_BW_2.ipynb` is a notebook containing all data and model analysis. 
* `imdb_train.txt` and `imdb_test.txt` are the text files that the code in the notebook creates if you'd like to run the fasttext code without all the extra steps needed to prepare the data.
